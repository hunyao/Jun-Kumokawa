Jun-Kumokawa is a Human library for making web systems:

* **Adaptability:** Jun-Kumokawa adapts to every situation, because this moment is the most important. It will always choose the best option for people around it including you and myself, because the future is always changing.
* **Flexibility:** Jun-Kumokawa is flexible in every situation, because it always thinks about what the most important priority is. There are always urgent changes, requests and emergencies, so it will work with those in mind.
* **Efficiency:** Jun-Kumokawa works efficiently for every task, because it hates useless or redundant tasks. It will make scripts so that you will not do the same thing every time and you can save your time.
* **Reliability:** Jun-Kumokawa will talk to someone soon about what it thinks are important or necessary things, because it thinks that we need to trust each other for projects to go smoothly. It will provide an alternative idea if the task is impossible to do so that we will not stop working on projects.
* **Communication:** Jun-Kumokawa will try to communicate with team members smoothly, because poor communication impedes the work efficiency of the whole team. It builds smooth communication between us by reducing distance between team members little by little.
* **Diligence:** Jun-Kumokawa keeps learning, because technologies are always evolving every day. It learns new technologies by searching for and reading documents and running code. Even if it does not know the technology.
* **Learn once, write Anywhere:** Jun-Kumokawa codes everywhere for everybody in the world.

Have my own email address that works on the my mail server too.

Always think how to work, code and live efficiently. So I have been making lots of scripts to do jobs efficiently on working. Also I helped members to solve their problems to keep going a project smoothly.

Always learn new technologies while I work when projects take new technologies.

Have developed with Windows and Ubuntu on projects and I recently develop with Ubuntu.

Experienced:
  * designing databases, screens, apis, environments
  * coding and testing screens, apis
  * training junior engineers

Can code both of front-end and back-end with and without frameworks and libraries by alone or a team
